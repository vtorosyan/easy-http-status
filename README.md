### Additional notes
- The source code of the hosted program is not synced with the source code in this repo. It is available [here](https://github.com/vtorosyan/vtorosyan.github.io/tree/master/easy-http-status).
- Public [gist](https://gist.github.com/vtorosyan/49765f9e1b0a4833ace46a7f04b92f89) is available with the JSON data holding HTTP Statuses, questions and answers.

### Inspired from 
There is a great blog [post](http://racksburg.com/choosing-an-http-status-code/) where from the idea came and some of the questions have been also used from that source.
